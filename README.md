Implementation Details

The react-infinite-scroller library is used to implement infinite scrolling.
Data is fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API to simulate paginated data.
The axios library is used for making HTTP requests to the API.
Each API request fetches 10 items, and the next page is loaded when you scroll to the bottom of the page.

Customization
You can customize this example to fit your needs by modifying the following parts of the code:

Adjust the API endpoint URL in the fetchData function to fetch data from your desired API.
Customize the UI and styling in the App.css and component rendering.
